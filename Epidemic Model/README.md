# Spread of an epidemic with varying restrictions
Made in 2020, 2 friends (and school partners) and I decided to simulate an epidemic model (SEIR) based on the several parameters that could have been obtained by simply diving into the several official reports available.
We ran several simulations, applying different kind of restrictions on the network (strict social bubble, social bubble as most of the population understood it, no restriction...)
Obviously, the simulations highlighted how important keeping distances and reducing contact was at the time.
